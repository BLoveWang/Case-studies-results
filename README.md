We give here the "Case-studies-results" in the manuscript "Reduced Order Bus Frequency Response Model for Bulk Power Systems".

In the first file "Results of New Englanad 39-Bus System.xlsx", there are four sheets giving the frequency response curves and corresponding frequency nadirs solved by PSASP, BFR, and SFR models.

In the second file "Results of Province Power System.xlsx", there are five sheets giving the system description and the frequency response curves and corresponding statistical indexes (MAPE, RMSE, R^2) solved by PSASP, BFR, and SFR models.
